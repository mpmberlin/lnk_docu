# Crypto Address Score

`POST`  /check/crypto_address

Set of endpoints to analyze the score of a wallet address and subscribe to monitoring service.









## 2. Address score

`POST` /check/crypto_address/score

Retrieves a normalized AML risk score and detailed risk metadata for a given blockchain address.
A higher score means greater AML risk; the API also classifies it into four severity bands:
Low: 0 – 30; 
Moderate: 31 – 70;
High: 71 – 90;
Severe: 91 – 100;

#### Response fields
- **`risk_score`** (Integer):  
  Normalized AML risk rating from 3 to 100; higher is more risky.
- **`hacking_event`** (Saddamtring):  
  Name of any known breach or exploit linked to this address/transaction; empty if none.
- **`risk_score`** (Integer):  
  Normalized AML risk rating from 3 to 100; higher is more risky.
- **`flags`** (Integer):  
  Human-readable tags summarizing key risk drivers.
- **`risk_detail`** (Array[Object]):  
  - **`label`** (String): Risk category name (e.g. `"Scam Token"`, `"Phishing"`).  
  - **`type`** (String): Classification (`"malicious"`, `"suspected_malicious"`, `"high_risk"`).  
  - **`volume`** (Float): Amount transacted in this incident.  
  - **`address`** (String): Counterparty or related address.  
  - **`percent`** (Float): Fraction of total volume exposed by this incident (e.g. `0.453` = 45.3%).
